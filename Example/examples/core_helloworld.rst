core_helloworld.py
==================

Abstract
^^^^^^^^

The very first pythonocc example. This uses to be the script
used to check the following points:

pythonocc installation is correct, i.e. pythonocc modules are found
and properly imported

a GUI manager is installed. Wether it is wxpython or pyqt/pyside, it's necessary
to display a 3d window

the rendering window can be initialized and set up, that is to say the
graphic driver and OpenGl works correctly.

If this example run on your machine, that means you're ready to explore the wide
pythonocc world and run all the other examples.
